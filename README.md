**Violence Detection System**
My projectâ€™s aim is to develop an intelligent Violence Detection System (VDS) that uses advanced technologies, including computer vision and deep learning, to automatically detect violent actions in real-time.

**Project's idea**
The idea of the system is to read a series of frames to detect violent action. First, read the skeleton key points of people and then send the frame to calculate the specific distance between two persons if they are close to each other, then take their skeleton key points for 64 frames to predict the actions if there is violence or not.
